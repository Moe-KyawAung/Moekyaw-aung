## About me
I build reliable mobile apps and scalable backend services. I love solving performance and reliability problems, designing simple APIs, and shipping delightful user experiences. My main focus areas are Android (Kotlin) and backend systems in Go — with occasional ventures into Python for tooling and ML/vision experiments.

- 🔭 I’m currently building production-grade microservices and Android libraries.
- 🌱 I’m learning advanced distributed systems design and ML pipelines.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy turning complex problems into small, testable components.

---

## What I do
- Android apps & UI: Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Coroutines, Room
- Backend systems in Go: REST, gRPC, microservices, observability
- DevOps & infra: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring
- Computer vision & ML experiments with Python (OpenCV, TensorFlow)
- Security-focused tooling and automated scanning
